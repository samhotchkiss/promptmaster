# Progress Log

## 2026-04-08

- Initialized the repo-local issue tracker for Prompt Master overnight work.
- Backfilled the current work into explicit issues so active/queued/completed state is visible.
- Completed issue 0004 with a concrete Otter Camp docsv2 review report and moved it to `05-completed`.
- Completed issue `0007` by adding the inbox/thread model spec and moving the issue record to `05-completed`.
- Drafted the skills and MCP integration proposal for issue 0005 and moved it to review.
- Moved issue `0006` into `02-in-progress` while iterating on the cockpit UI and live self-hosting flow.
- Added a first-pass extensibility/platform architecture in `docs/extensibility-architecture.md` and moved issue `0008` into review.
- Added ready implementation issues for plugin host, service API/frontend transport, pluggable memory, pluggable task backend, and provider plugin SDK work.
- Implemented the first plugin host with manifest discovery, built-in/user/repo precedence, API version checks, provider/runtime resolution, and safe observer/filter execution.
- Started issue `0010` by adding a first `PromptMasterService` layer and migrating worker creation/launch plus session focus/input flows in the TUI onto it.
- Started issue `0012` by extracting the default file issue tracker behind a task backend interface and routing tracker/scaffold/detail logic through it.
- Implemented issue `0011` by adding a pluggable memory backend interface with a default file-plus-SQLite implementation and checkpoint integration, then moved the issue to review.
- Added ready issues for a pluggable scheduler/cron backend, a pluggable heartbeat backend, and an agent profile backend so timing, monitoring, and agent behavior can be swapped like other platform subsystems.
- Implemented issue `0013` by adding a concrete provider SDK with transcript discovery, resume hooks, and usage snapshot collection, then moved the issue to review.
- Implemented issue `0010` by moving the TUI/control plane onto `PromptMasterService` for session bootstrap, account mutation, project mutation, lease control, and worker/session operations, then moved the issue to review.
- Implemented issue `0012` by broadening the file task backend seam across project scaffolding and control-room/task flows, adding note/count coverage, and moved the issue to review.
- Implemented issue `0014` by adding a pluggable scheduler seam with an inline backend, due-job execution, recurring jobs, and service/supervisor delegation.
- Implemented issue `0015` by delegating heartbeat execution through a pluggable heartbeat backend and shipping the built-in local monitor backend.
- Implemented issue `0016` by adding built-in agent profiles for Polly, heartbeat, and workers, then routing control-session prompts through the profile seam.
- Implemented issue `0003` by switching token accounting over to JSONL transcript ingestion for Claude/Codex, adding hourly token rollups, and moving the issue to review.
- Began swapping user-facing naming from Prompt Master toward PollyPM and Polly in onboarding and control-session prompts.

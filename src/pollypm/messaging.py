"""Thin notification shim over the durable alerts system.

This module used to back the legacy inbox subsystem (threads, messages,
state machine). Everything the rest of the codebase cared about — "tell
the user that X happened" — is now served by
:meth:`pollypm.storage.state.StateStore.upsert_alert` plus
``record_event`` for audit trail.

Callers are primarily the ``itsalive`` plugin for deploy-lifecycle
notifications. Functions here are intentionally small wrappers so the
call sites read naturally ("notify deploy complete" not "upsert_alert
with severity info and these exact kwargs").

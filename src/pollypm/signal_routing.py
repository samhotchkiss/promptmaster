"""Actionability-based signal routing and shared count API (#883).

Defines the structured-metadata envelope every cockpit signal
(alert, notification, inbox item, activity event) carries and the
single routing policy that decides which surfaces it lands on.

The pre-launch audit (``docs/launch-issue-audit-2026-04-27.md`` §3)
identifies the structural problem: events are routed by *caller
preference* — each emitter passes its own opinion of where the
signal should go — instead of by a *shared policy* that knows the
audience, severity, and actionability of the signal. The result is
the recurring pattern of:

* operational events surfaced as user alerts (#765);
* action-required events buried in Activity (#879 — automatic
  recovery paused after rapid failures and 98 ``no_session``
  alerts were visible only on the Activity log);
* the same concept counted differently by Rail and Home (#820 —
  Home counted tracked projects, Rail counted registered
  projects);
* synthetic / test event kinds polluting live signal.

This module is the structural fix. It does not rewrite every
emitter (too risky for v1) — it gives every emitter one envelope
type to populate, one policy function to consult, and one place
the audit asserts is consistent. Existing emitters migrate to it
gradually; new emitters must use it.

Migration policy: the launch-hardening release gate (#889)
inspects ``ROUTED_EMITTERS`` (a registry of modules already
migrated) and blocks v1 if a high-traffic emitter is missing.

Related modules:

* ``cockpit_alerts.py`` — owns the toast tier classification and
  ``AlertChannel`` enum. ``signal_routing`` re-exports
  ``AlertChannel`` and adds the wider envelope around it. The two
  modules are not redundant: ``cockpit_alerts`` is a single
  surface (toasts), ``signal_routing`` is the policy layer above
  every surface.
* ``cockpit_inbox.py`` — owns the inbox count reader.
  ``signal_routing.shared_inbox_count`` delegates to it so callers
  have one import path even if the implementation moves.
* ``events/summaries.py`` — packs activity-feed payload metadata.
  Migration to ``SignalEnvelope`` is one of the highest-value
  follow-ups.

"""Shared inbox item adapters for the cockpit inbox screen.

Contract:
- Inputs: loaded config objects, Store message rows, and work-service tasks.
- Outputs: a single inbox-item surface that lets the Textual inbox render
  Store-backed notifications and task-backed inbox rows together.
- Side effects: opens and closes Store / SQLite readers while loading.
- Invariants: item ids are stable across refreshes, message rows stay
  read-only, and task-backed thread replies continue to flow through the
  work-service path unchanged.

    """Drop ``plan_review`` rows whose user_approval is already APPROVED.

    Per-render filter — the proper fix is an event listener that
    archives the inbox row on approval-completion (#1103). Until that
    lands, this keeps stale "Plan ready for review" rows from sitting
    in the action lens for days after the approval has happened at the
    work-service layer.

    Logs the number of phantom rows filtered so we can measure inbox
    cleanup and decide when the proper sweeper is needed.

    Task-backed plan-review rows are checked against their loaded task
    state directly. Message-backed rows still resolve their
    ``plan_task:<project/number>`` labels through the DB map.

    DB resolution: ``project_db_paths`` may carry both per-project
    entries (``project_key -> (db, project_path)``) AND a workspace-root
    entry under the ``__workspace__`` sentinel key. When a plan_review's
    referenced project has no per-project DB, the workspace-root DB is
    consulted as a fallback — most users keep all task state in the
    workspace-root db rather than per-project ones (#1103 tick-5
    follow-up: filter previously found zero phantoms because the
    smoketest ref's project had no per-project db).

"""Canonical role/persona invariant for kickoff and live sessions (#885).

One contract — one dataclass, one registry, one validator —
covering every role-identity check that was previously scattered
across :mod:`pollypm.role_routing`, :mod:`pollypm.role_banner`,
:mod:`pollypm.heartbeats.local`,
:mod:`pollypm.architect_lifecycle`,
:mod:`pollypm.project_guides`, and
:mod:`pollypm.work.sqlite_service`.

The pre-launch audit (``docs/launch-issue-audit-2026-04-27.md``
§4) cites the recurring shape:

* `#757` — Polly session identified as Russell after kickoff-time
  persona defense had already passed.
* `#758` — wrong-role kickoff clobbered the operator session.
* `#762` / `#755` — update / guide paths can be wrong or rejected
  as prompt injection.
* `#869`/`#868` — persona / role launch surfaces remain brittle.

The contract is the structural fix. Every consumer (kickoff
launcher, role banner, heartbeat drift detector, remediation
message builder, work-service actor validator) reads from one
:class:`RoleContract` per role, so adding / renaming / changing
a role is one edit instead of seven.

Architecture:

* :class:`RoleContract` — frozen dataclass with the per-role
  invariant: canonical key, persona display name, guide path,
  required identity markers, and remediation policy.
* :data:`ROLE_REGISTRY` — module-level mapping from canonical
  role key to :class:`RoleContract`.
* :func:`canonical_role` — normalise an input string to the
  canonical key, raising on unknown roles.
* :func:`persona_for` / :func:`guide_path_for` /
  :func:`identity_markers_for` — typed accessors.
* :func:`validate_identity` — given a role and a pane snapshot,
  return ``None`` (identity matches) or the persona name the
  session drifted into. Pure; tested in isolation.
* :func:`build_remediation_message` — the canonical wording the
  heartbeat sends on drift. Centralised so #755 / #757 fixes do
  not have to be re-invented in each emitter.

Migration: existing readers continue to work — the legacy module-
local ``_ROLE_KEYS`` / ``_ROLE_PERSONA_NAMES`` / ``_ROLE_GUIDE_PATHS``
dicts are valid for the moment. New code must consult
:data:`ROLE_REGISTRY`. The launch-hardening release gate (#889)
will assert that every legacy table agrees with the registry
before tagging v1.

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class RoleContract:
    """Per-role invariant declaration.

    The frozen + slots dataclass is intentional — once
    instantiated and registered, a contract is the canonical
    answer for that role. Mutation would let one consumer change
    the contract for everyone else, which is exactly the bug
    shape this module exists to prevent.

    Fields:

    * ``key`` — canonical role identifier (snake_case). The same
      string the work service stores in ``actor`` columns and
      the supervisor uses to plan launches.
    * ``persona_name`` — the human-facing name the session
      should identify as (e.g., ``"Polly"`` for ``operator_pm``).
    * ``guide_path`` — repository-relative path to the role's
      canonical operating guide. Migrating to a packaged data
      path is on the work-service-spec roadmap; the path here is
      the source of truth until then.
    * ``identity_markers`` — substrings that, when present in a
      pane snapshot, prove the session is operating as this
      role. Heartbeat drift detection scans for them.
    * ``conflicting_personas`` — explicit list of *other* persona
      names that, if they appear, mean this session has drifted.
      Disjoint from ``identity_markers`` in every test.
    * ``can_write_session_state`` — whether this role is allowed
      to mutate persisted session state through the heartbeat
      API. Mirrors the existing ``_MUTATING_SESSION_ROLES``
      frozenset in :mod:`pollypm.heartbeats.local`.
    * ``has_project_guide`` — whether the role gets per-project
      override guides under ``<project>/.pollypm/project-guides/``.
      The operator does not (its guide is global).

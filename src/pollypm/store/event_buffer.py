"""Fire-and-forget event buffer — bounded queue → batched ``messages`` inserts.

Most PollyPM subsystems want to emit a firehose event without caring whether
the DB is momentarily busy: the supervisor heartbeat, flow-engine transitions,
pane-pattern matches, etc. Routing every single emit through a synchronous
insert puts a serialized-writer stall on the hot path and can cascade into
worker-session latency.

This module solves that with a classic producer/consumer:

* Callers invoke :meth:`EventBuffer.append` — a non-blocking enqueue onto a
  bounded :class:`queue.Queue` (capacity 10k). Overflow drops the oldest
  pending event with a log line (never the new one — the newest signal is
  usually the most interesting).
* A single background thread drains the queue, batching up to
  ``batch_size`` rows per transaction or flushing every ``flush_interval``
  seconds — whichever comes first.
* Every batch commits in one short-lived writer transaction so the pool's
  ``pool_size=1`` never wedges.

Shutdown paths (``close()`` and the ``SIGTERM``/``SIGINT`` handlers) are
idempotent and guarantee a final flush of anything already enqueued. The
signal handler intentionally chains to any pre-existing handler so PollyPM
doesn't eat Ctrl-C for the host process.

Issue #338. The buffer currently only emits rows with ``type='event'``;
future issues layering on notify/alert tiers will inject via their own
:class:`SQLAlchemyStore` methods rather than this queue.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store:
        The :class:`SQLAlchemyStore` owning the writer engine. Held by
        reference so the buffer always uses the store's current engine
        (important if the store ever hot-swaps URLs during tests).
    batch_size:
        Soft upper bound on rows drained per transaction. Default 100;
        tuned so a single ``executemany`` fits comfortably below SQLite's
        implicit statement cache ceiling.
    flush_interval:
        Seconds to wait for a full batch before committing whatever is
        pending. Default 0.1s — low enough that events are visible to
        readers within a frame of the UI refresh rate.
    capacity:
        Maximum number of queued-but-undrained events. Default 10_000.
        Full-capacity behavior drops the OLDEST pending event (not the
        new one) with a warning log, so live signals never vanish.
    install_signal_handlers:
        If ``True`` (default), install process-wide ``SIGTERM``/``SIGINT``
        handlers on the first buffer in the process. The handlers chain
        to whatever handler was previously registered, so Ctrl-C still
        bubbles up to pytest / the supervisor main loop.

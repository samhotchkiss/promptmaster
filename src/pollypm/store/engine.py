"""SQLAlchemy engine factory — dual-pool writer/reader split for SQLite WAL.

Why dual pools: SQLite in WAL mode allows many concurrent readers but
serializes writers. Instead of fighting that with ``busy_timeout`` + retry
loops sprinkled through call sites, we expose it in the connection topology:

* **Writer engine** — ``QueuePool(pool_size=1, max_overflow=0)``. Every write
  transaction blocks on the single connection, so application code never sees
  "database is locked" under contention.
* **Reader engine** — ``QueuePool(pool_size=5)``. Multiple threads can read
  concurrently against the WAL snapshot without stepping on the writer.

SQLite pragmas (WAL, busy_timeout, synchronous=NORMAL, foreign_keys=ON) are
applied on every new connection via ``event.listens_for(engine, "connect")``.
:func:`is_sqlite` gates the pragma hook so the same factory will work against
a future Postgres URL without throwing "unknown pragma" errors on connect.

Issue #337 — foundation only. No schema, no table creation, no callers.

"""Render memory recall into a session-prompt section (M05 / #234).

The load-bearing function here is :func:`build_memory_injection`.
Given a memory backend, a user scope, a project scope, and a short
``task_context_summary``, it calls ``backend.recall(...)`` and renders
the top-N entries into a ``## What you should know`` markdown section
that a session service can prepend to its persona prompt.

Deterministic: for a fixed store, fixed (user, project, task) triple,
the output is byte-identical. We rely on ``MemoryBackend.recall`` being
deterministic for a fixed query+store (it is — SQL ORDER BY + tie-break
by id DESC). The pure render function here doesn't introduce any
non-determinism.

Budget: 4K tokens, approximated as 16K UTF-8 chars (≈4 chars/token).
If the rendered section would exceed the budget, the lowest-score
entries drop out first.

wg02 / #239 extension: :func:`build_worker_protocol_injection` prepends
the canonical worker guide under a "Worker Protocol" heading when the
session role is ``worker``. This sits *above* the memory injection so
every worker session boots knowing the task lifecycle before any
recall-based context.

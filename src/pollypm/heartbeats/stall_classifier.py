"""Stall-class classifier for the heartbeat loop (#765).

The heartbeat's ``suspected_loop`` detector fires whenever a session's
pane snapshot is identical for three consecutive heartbeats. That
detection is cheap and broad; it catches real stalls, but it also
catches the dominant normal case — a control-plane session, an
architect waiting for plan approval, a worker with an empty queue —
where the pane is *supposed* to be quiet. Surfacing every one of those
to the user as a warning trains them to dismiss the warning, so when a
real stall arrives it's already tuned out.

This module separates detection from classification. The heartbeat
still runs its cheap equality check; on a hit, it hands the context
here. :func:`classify_stall` returns one of three classes:

- ``legitimate_idle``  — the session is doing exactly what the system
  wants it to do (waiting for approval, no queued work, etc.). No
  alert, no log warning, no user-visible signal.
- ``transient``        — the session is probably still working (recently
  nudged, model is known to take long turns, etc.). Give it another
  tick before deciding.
- ``unrecoverable_stall`` — the session looks actually stuck. Remediate
  (nudge / restart) before escalating to the user.

Only ``unrecoverable_stall`` is supposed to become an alert, and even
then via the remediation ladder in the heartbeat itself, not a direct
toast.

The classifier here is deliberately conservative: when a case is
ambiguous, it errs on ``legitimate_idle`` rather than ``unrecoverable_stall``.
A missed real stall is a single delayed detection on the next heartbeat;
a false-positive stall alert is user trust damage that persists.

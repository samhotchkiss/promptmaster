"""Wire the sealed heartbeat + job queue + worker pool from config.

``HeartbeatRail`` is the small orchestration object that constructs the three
moving parts of the Track 7 architecture and starts them together:

* ``JobQueue`` — durable SQLite-backed queue (on ``config.project.state_db``).
* ``JobWorkerPool`` — background workers drain the queue via the plugin
  host's ``JobHandlerRegistry``.
* ``Heartbeat`` — sealed tick, consults the plugin-built roster and
  enqueues jobs at their scheduled cadences.

The heartbeat's tick cadence is driven by an external timer (the existing
supervisor or a user-level loop). HeartbeatRail only wires construction +
lifecycle; callers call ``tick()`` themselves when they're ready.

The worker concurrency is read from ``[heartbeat.workers]`` in the
``pollypm.toml`` config when present — default 4 if unspecified. Keeping
the knob in config avoids plumbing it through every construction call.

    registry is also resolved via the plugin host so newly-registered
    handlers fire on the next tick without a restart.

    ``start()`` also spawns a daemon ticker thread that calls ``tick()``
    on a fixed interval so any long-lived process that calls
    ``rail.start()`` gets periodic ticks for free. The ticker exits when
    ``stop()`` sets the stop event. For tests, use ``tick()`` directly —
    the ticker is a deployment-time convenience, not a test dependency.

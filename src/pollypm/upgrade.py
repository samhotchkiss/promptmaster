"""``pm upgrade`` — detect the install method, delegate to the right
package manager, and wire the migration / notice-injection hooks (#716).

Design goals:

* **One command everywhere.** `pm upgrade` works whether the user
  installed via ``uv tool install``, ``pip``, ``brew``, or ``npm -g``.
  The wrapper detects which (in priority order) and shells out.
* **Safe-by-default.** Before any mutation, the migration check from
  #717 runs. On failure, upgrade aborts with a specific error — the
  user is never left on a half-upgraded install.
* **Observable.** Each step streams to stdout with a ``[step]`` prefix
  so a log / pane can show progress. The caller (rail one-click in
  #719) reads these markers.
* **No new dependencies.** Detection uses ``shutil.which`` and
  ``subprocess.run``; no external libraries.

The dependent issues (#717 migration gate, #718 notice injection) are
invoked via import-if-available so this module works on a system where
either hasn't landed yet — we log "skipped: not yet implemented" and
carry on. Once those merge, the stubs become real calls without
touching this module.

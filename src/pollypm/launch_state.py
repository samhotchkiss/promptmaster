"""Idempotent tmux/session launch state machine (#884).

Models ``pm up`` as an explicit state machine instead of the
sequence of nested if/else branches in :mod:`pollypm.cli`. The
state machine is pure: from a read-only :class:`LaunchProbe`
(snapshot of tmux state), it returns a :class:`LaunchPlan` that
names the state, names the actions to take, and explains the
reasoning.

The pre-launch audit (``docs/launch-issue-audit-2026-04-27.md``
§4) cites the recurring shape: launch / reattach / upgrade
restart / stale-pane recovery were handled as overlapping branches,
not separate states. Symptoms:

* ``#841`` — relaunch / respawn hit a tmux segfault and dropped
  the cockpit session into raw Claude Code without a Polly
  return affordance.
* ``#871`` — cockpit session inventory reported zero sessions
  while tmux had live operator/reviewer/architect/heartbeat
  windows.
* ``#817`` — ``pm up`` created an idle shell where it should
  have attached an existing rail.
* ``#808`` — upgrade restart cycle dropped persistent state.

The state machine is the structural fix. ``pm up`` calls
:func:`plan_launch` to decide *what* to do, then performs the
actions. The test suite exercises every state by constructing a
synthetic probe — no live tmux required.

Migration policy: the existing call sites in :mod:`pollypm.cli`
keep their concrete behavior but consult the state machine for
classification. New launch paths must go through the state
machine; the contract is a launch test (#884 acceptance criteria
4) covering outside tmux, inside unrelated tmux, inside existing
Polly tmux, after upgrade, with stale/dead panes, with storage
closet already running.

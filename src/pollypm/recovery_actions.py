"""Recovery actions for blocked / on-hold tasks (#1016).

The project Dashboard, Tasks pane row, and individual task detail view
all describe *why* a task is stuck — but until this module landed they
never told the operator *what to do next*. ``recovery_action_for(task)``
parses the task's hold/blocker reason against a small dispatch table and
returns a typed :class:`RecoveryAction` the rendering layers can show
verbatim.

The dispatch table covers the canonical reason prefixes emitted today:

* ``paused: dirty project root <path>`` /
  ``paused: project root has uncommitted changes`` —
  produce ``git -C <path> add … && git commit …`` followed by
  ``pm task resume <task>``.
* ``paused: review passed but auto-merge refused: <reason>`` /
  ``cannot auto-merge`` — surface the underlying reason and a retry
  affordance (``pm task approve <task> --retry``).
* ``blocked: waiting on <dep>`` — point the operator at the upstream
  task to unblock first.
* ``on_hold: waiting on operator decision: <question>`` /
  ``Waiting on operator: …`` — open the inbox so the operator can
  respond.
* ``on_hold: permission prompt`` — point at the pane that has the
  prompt open.

Anything else falls through to the generic
``Open inbox / task to investigate`` affordance so the renderer always
has *some* concrete next step to show, even for novel reasons.

The renderers (``cockpit_ui._render_pipeline``, the Tasks pane row, and
``cockpit_tasks._render_overview``) call :func:`recovery_action_for`
once per task and decide layout. The keybinding wiring lives with the
renderers — this module is pure data.

"""Real change-detection for the advisor tick.

Replaces the ad01 stub. Given a project path and a ``since`` cutoff,
returns a :class:`ChangeReport` summarizing:

* ``commit_shas`` — commit SHAs authored in the project since ``since``.
* ``changed_files`` — files touched by those commits (union of the
  per-commit name-only diffs).
* ``task_transitions`` — work-service transitions in the project's
  ``work_transitions`` table since ``since``.
* ``files_diff_summary`` — short machine-readable summary ("N commits,
  M files changed") for the tick-handler log; the heavyweight per-file
  diff text is packed by ad03's assess.py when a session is launched.

The report is intentionally small — ad02 does detection, not diff text.
Per-file diff text ingest is ad03's ``assess.py`` where the context
pack gets built.

The ``has_changes`` flag lights up when either ≥1 commit OR ≥1 task
transition is visible in the window. The advisor tick short-circuits
on ``has_changes == False`` — the whole project contributes a single
``no-changes`` row and no session is scheduled.

Cache: per-tick cache keyed by ``(project_path, since_iso)``. The tick
handler runs once every 30 minutes; repeated calls for the same project
inside a tick (as defensive re-reads by downstream ad03 helpers) use
the cached report instead of re-shelling out to git.

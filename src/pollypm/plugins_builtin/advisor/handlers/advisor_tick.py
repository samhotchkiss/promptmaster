"""Half-hourly advisor tick.

Registered as ``advisor.tick`` on the job-handler registry and fired by
the roster on the configured cadence (default ``@every 30m``). The
handler itself is cheap: it walks tracked projects, checks the enabled
flag + pause marker, calls ``detect_changes`` (stubbed in ad01, real in
ad02), and for projects with meaningful activity enqueues an
``advisor_review`` work task — unless an earlier advisor task is still
in flight, in which case the project is skipped to prevent pile-up.

Out of scope for ad01:

* Real change detection (ad02 replaces the stub in ``detect_changes.py``).
* Context packing + session launch (ad03).
* History log write (ad04).
* Inbox emission on emit (ad05).

The tick handler is intentionally non-raising — any per-project failure
is logged and the next project still gets its turn.

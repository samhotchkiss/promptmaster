"""Built-in ``task_assignment_notify`` plugin.

Subscribes to the in-process ``TaskAssignmentEvent`` bus (fed by
``SQLiteWorkService._sync_transition``) and registers a ``@every 30s``
sweeper so events dropped on restart or emitted before a target session
exists still get delivered.

Design: see issue #244 and ``pollypm.work.task_assignment``. No
SessionService protocol change — the target session is resolved purely
by naming convention (``worker-<project>`` / ``worker_<project>``,
``pm-reviewer``, etc.).

Also subscribes to ``SessionCreatedEvent`` (#246): when a fresh session
comes online, replay any outstanding queued / in_progress / review
pings that target it. This closes the supervisor-restart resume gap
without waiting on the 30-second sweeper cadence — dedupe still
applies, so re-pings inside the 30-minute window are suppressed.

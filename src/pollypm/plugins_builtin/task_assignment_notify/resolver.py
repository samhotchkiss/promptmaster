    Narrower companion to :func:`clear_alerts_for_cancelled_task` for
    transitions where only the per-task alert is unambiguously stale,
    e.g. ``approve`` taking a task out of ``review`` (#953). The
    project-level ``worker-<project>/no_session`` alert is intentionally
    left alone — the task may still be active under a new role on the
    same project, and other active siblings may still need the role.

    Best-effort: any error opening services / clearing the alert is
    swallowed. The next sweep tick will re-emit if the task somehow
    re-enters an active state with no matching session.

    ``store`` lets the caller inject the alert store directly — the
    work-service approve path does this so we don't open a second
    SQLite connection against the same DB while the caller's
    transaction is still in flight. When ``store`` is ``None`` we
    resolve runtime services from config and use the resulting
    msg_store/state_store handle.

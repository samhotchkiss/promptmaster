"""``task_assignment.sweep`` job handler — the @every 30s fallback.

Catches assignment events that the in-process listener missed (daemon
restart mid-transition, sessions that booted after the original
transition, pre-existing state at plugin install).

Strategy: enumerate every task whose ``work_status`` is ``queued``,
``review``, or ``in_progress`` whose *current node* has
``actor_type != HUMAN``. For each, re-emit a ``TaskAssignmentEvent`` —
``notify()`` itself enforces the 30-minute throttle so this is cheap
to call frequently.

The ``in_progress`` branch (#246) is gated on session idleness — a
worker that's actively turning shouldn't be pinged mid-work. When the
target session is busy (active turn indicator visible in the pane),
we skip the ping and let the sweeper re-check on its next cadence.

#259: the sweeper now fans out across per-project work-service DBs.
``pm project new`` creates tasks in ``<project_path>/.pollypm/state.db``
— those are invisible to a sweep that only reads the workspace-root
DB, so pickup pings never fire for operator-created projects. We
enumerate ``config.projects`` (exposed as ``services.known_projects``)
and run the same sweep body against each per-project DB, opening and
closing the connection per tick. When a project has queued tasks for
a role that has no live session, we emit a single deduped
``no_session`` alert per ``(project, role)`` — surfacing the blocked
worker to the operator instead of silently dropping pings.

#273: project-level plan-presence enforcement. Before emitting a ping
for a queued non-planning task, the sweeper consults
``has_acceptable_plan`` — a project without an approved, non-trivial
``docs/plan/plan.md`` blocks *new delegation* until planning is done.
Tasks already in ``review`` / ``in_progress`` keep their recovery
re-pings even if the plan later goes stale or disappears; the gate is
only about admitting new queued work. Blocked projects get a single
deduped ``plan_missing`` alert per sweep cycle. Planning tasks
(``plan_project`` / ``critique_flow``) and tasks labelled
``bypass_plan_gate`` skate past the gate so the planner can always
run and operators can force delegation when needed.

# #1012 — auto-claim circuit breaker.
#
# When a task's per-task worker spawn fails repeatedly (no live tmux
# window after each ``release_stale_claim`` → re-claim cycle), the
# sweep used to keep retrying forever, accumulating one ``build vN
# abandoned`` row per cycle (~50s apart). ``bikepath/8`` racked up
# 60+ rows in ~7h before the user noticed.
#
# After ``MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ABANDONMENTS`` consecutive abandoned rows on
# the active node, ``_recover_dead_claims`` stops releasing the stale
# claim — the task stays ``in_progress`` with a dead assignee, and the
# project's ``worker-<project>/no_session`` warn alert is escalated to
# a ``worker-<project>/spawn_failed_persistent`` error so the user
# sees an actionable blocker rather than a silent grow-the-history
# loop.

# Worker-session-gap alerts (#1054)

#
# Sister of #1053. The auto-claim sweep can emit ``no_session`` alerts
# only when it actually visits a queued task and notify() reports
# ``no_session`` for it — but that path is gated on the plan-presence
# check, idle-session checks, the throttle, and a few other branches
# that can each silently skip the per-task ping. The result observed
# in #1054: ``polly_remote`` had four queued worker tasks but no
# ``worker_<project>`` (or ``worker-<project>``) tmux session, and
# nothing surfaced the gap to the user. The post-sweep pass below
# walks the registered projects after the main sweep has run, counts
# ``work_status='queued'`` rows per project, and emits a
# ``worker_session_gap`` alert for any project whose worker session is
# absent from the storage-closet's window list. Auto-clears when a
# matching window appears (or when the project's queue empties).

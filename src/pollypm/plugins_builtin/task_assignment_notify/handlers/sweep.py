"""``task_assignment.sweep`` job handler — the @every 30s fallback.

Catches assignment events that the in-process listener missed (daemon
restart mid-transition, sessions that booted after the original
transition, pre-existing state at plugin install).

Strategy: enumerate every task whose ``work_status`` is ``queued``,
``review``, or ``in_progress`` whose *current node* has
``actor_type != HUMAN``. For each, re-emit a ``TaskAssignmentEvent`` —
``notify()`` itself enforces the 30-minute throttle so this is cheap
to call frequently.

The ``in_progress`` branch (#246) is gated on session idleness — a
worker that's actively turning shouldn't be pinged mid-work. When the
target session is busy (active turn indicator visible in the pane),
we skip the ping and let the sweeper re-check on its next cadence.

#259: the sweeper now fans out across per-project work-service DBs.
``pm project new`` creates tasks in ``<project_path>/.pollypm/state.db``
— those are invisible to a sweep that only reads the workspace-root
DB, so pickup pings never fire for operator-created projects. We
enumerate ``config.projects`` (exposed as ``services.known_projects``)
and run the same sweep body against each per-project DB, opening and
closing the connection per tick. When a project has queued tasks for
a role that has no live session, we emit a single deduped
``no_session`` alert per ``(project, role)`` — surfacing the blocked
worker to the operator instead of silently dropping pings.

#273: project-level plan-presence enforcement. Before emitting a ping
for a queued non-planning task, the sweeper consults
``has_acceptable_plan`` — a project without an approved, non-trivial
``docs/plan/plan.md`` blocks *new delegation* until planning is done.
Tasks already in ``review`` / ``in_progress`` keep their recovery
re-pings even if the plan later goes stale or disappears; the gate is
only about admitting new queued work. Blocked projects get a single
deduped ``plan_missing`` alert per sweep cycle. Planning tasks
(``plan_project`` / ``critique_flow``) and tasks labelled
``bypass_plan_gate`` skate past the gate so the planner can always
run and operators can force delegation when needed.

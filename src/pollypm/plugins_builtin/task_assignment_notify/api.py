"""Public-API re-exports for ``task_assignment_notify``.

The plugin's sweep helpers were originally private (underscore-prefixed)
implementation details. ``core_recurring.sweeps`` imports several of
them as part of the work-progress sweep pipeline, which made the two
plugins de-facto inseparable through a hidden private contract (#802).

Rather than duplicate the logic or collapse the plugins together, this
module promotes the cross-plugin dependencies to a documented public
surface. ``core_recurring`` (and any future caller that needs the same
hooks) imports from here; the underscored names remain in
``handlers/sweep.py`` for plugin-internal use, and can be refactored
without breaking external callers as long as the names re-exported
here keep their published shape.

Core runtime callers route through the same surface (#939):

* ``pollypm.work.service_transition_manager`` — uses
  :func:`clear_alerts_for_cancelled_task` from the cancel path so
  the alert hygiene fix from #927 doesn't pin core to a private
  resolver symbol.
* ``pollypm.heartbeats.local`` — uses :func:`build_event_for_task`,
  :func:`load_runtime_services`, :func:`notify`, and
  :data:`DEDUPE_WINDOW_SECONDS` to fire resume pings without
  reaching into ``handlers.sweep`` / ``resolver`` privately.
* ``pollypm.cockpit_tasks`` — uses
  :data:`RECENT_SWEEPER_PING_SECONDS` and
  :data:`SWEEPER_PING_CONTEXT_ENTRY_TYPE` to derive the recently-
  pinged badge without importing the sweep handler module.

If a future caller needs another helper, promote it here first, then
update the caller — never let core depend on an underscored name from
the plugin's internals.

Each public name is implemented as a thin trampoline that resolves the
underlying private function via attribute lookup at call time. That
preserves test ergonomics: monkeypatching the source module
(``resolver`` / ``handlers.sweep``) propagates through the public
surface without callers having to know which physical module hosts
the implementation.

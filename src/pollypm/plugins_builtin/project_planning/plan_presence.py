"""Plan-presence gate — issues #273, #281.

The sweeper refuses to delegate implementation tasks for a project
until that project has a non-trivial, user-approved plan on disk.
This module owns the predicate — ``has_acceptable_plan`` — and the
bypass check that lets the planner itself (plus explicit opt-outs)
skate past the gate.

Layout (locked in with the user):

    <project>/
      docs/
        plan/
          plan.md            <- canonical forward plan (gate reads this)
          milestones/        <- optional auxiliary files
          architecture.md    <- optional
          ...

The default plan directory is ``docs/plan``; it is overridable via
``[planner].plan_dir`` in ``pollypm.toml``. An absolute ``plan_dir``
is honoured as-is; a relative path resolves against the project root.

A plan is "acceptable" iff ALL of the following hold:

1. ``<project>/<plan_dir>/plan.md`` exists and has > 500 bytes of
   content after whitespace stripping. The byte threshold filters out
   empty scaffolding; it's not a quality bar, just a presence check.
2. At least one ``plan_project`` task exists for the project in the
   work-service with ``work_status='done'``.
3. That done task's ``user_approval`` flow-node execution carries a
   ``decision='approved'`` — a ``rejected`` decision disqualifies the
   plan even if the file looks complete.
4. The plan's approval timestamp is greater than or equal to the most
   recent non-planning task's ``created_at`` timestamp in the project.
   Projects with no non-planning tasks auto-pass this staleness check.
   (#281) The approval timestamp comes from a ``plan_approved`` context
   entry written when the user approves the user_approval node. For
   plans approved before this change shipped, the timestamp falls back
   to the ``user_approval`` execution's ``completed_at``. File mtime
   is **not** used — git operations, editor saves, and the planner's
   own stage-8 emit all perturb it, making the gate unstable.

A separate helper — ``task_bypasses_plan_gate`` — returns True when a
task should skip the gate entirely. Two cases:

* The task is itself on the ``plan_project`` or ``critique_flow`` flow
  template. The planner can't be gated on its own output.
* The task carries the ``bypass_plan_gate`` label (explicit opt-out
  for migrations, hotfixes, operator bypass).

"""Planner → downtime-backlog integration (dt04).

During Synthesis (stage 6), the planner emits a machine-readable
downtime backlog to ``docs/downtime-backlog.md``. The downtime plugin
reads this file in ``pick_candidate`` to source exploration tasks (spec
§4 / §8). The cross-plugin contract is pure file output — no shared
imports, no direct API call.

Three streams of entries land in the backlog:

1. **Non-winning tree-of-plans candidates** — every candidate the
   architect emitted at stage 2 that didn't win synthesis becomes a
   ``kind=try_alt_approach`` entry. The synthesis rationale supplies
   the "why deprioritized" text.
2. **Critic-deprioritized magic items** — items the architect flagged
   during the Magic stage (stage 4) that critics pushed back on but
   weren't discarded outright. Stored as ``kind=spec_feature`` or
   ``kind=build_speculative`` depending on the architect's hint.
3. **"Explore later" notes** — anything the architect explicitly
   flagged during any stage as worth revisiting after v1 ships. Pass
   as ``explore_later_notes`` to :func:`synthesize_backlog_entries`.

The file format is the markdown table the downtime plugin's
``parse_backlog`` already reads. Merges are title-based: if a row with
the same title already exists in the file, the existing row wins and
the new entry is skipped (planner reruns don't duplicate history).

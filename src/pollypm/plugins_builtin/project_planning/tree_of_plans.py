"""Tree-of-plans helpers for stages 2, 5, and 6 of plan_project.

Spec §3 stage 2: the architect emits 2-3 candidate decompositions, not
one. Each candidate is its own artifact (`candidate_A.md`,
`candidate_B.md`, `candidate_C.md`) written into the planning worktree.
Stage 5 critics evaluate **all** candidates and emit per-candidate
scores via the critique JSON. Stage 6 synthesis reads the critic JSONs,
picks the winner via per-critic consensus, and writes the rationale
into the planning session log.

This module owns three concerns:

1. Candidate identifiers and path resolution (``CandidateId``,
   ``candidate_artifact_path``). Capped at 3 per spec.
2. The decompose-stage prompt augmentation that spells out the
   tree-of-plans contract the architect must honour.
3. The synthesis algorithm: given a list of critic JSONs, return the
   winning candidate id + a structured rationale the architect folds
   into ``docs/project-plan.md`` and ``docs/planning-session-log.md``.

The algorithm is deliberately simple for v1: pick the candidate with
the highest average score across critics; ties broken by preferred-
candidate votes; remaining ties broken by alphabetic id. Book Ch 17
(Tree of Thoughts) only prescribes "branch + select"; the selection
heuristic is an implementation detail we can tune later.

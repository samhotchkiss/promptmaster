"""Plugin wiring for ``human_notify``.

Registers a listener on the ``TaskAssignmentEvent`` bus, assembles
the adapter chain (macOS + webhook + cockpit + anything registered
via the ``pollypm.human_notifier`` entry-point group), and fans
out each ``ActorType.HUMAN`` event through the dispatcher.

No new job handlers or roster entries — human-addressed pushes
ride the same synchronous bus hook ``task_assignment_notify`` uses
for worker/architect pings. That means a human push arrives in the
same tick as a worker push does, not on a separate cadence.

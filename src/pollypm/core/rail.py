"""CoreRail — the rail that owns config, state store, and plugin host.

The rail is additive scaffolding at this step: nothing has moved out of
:class:`pollypm.supervisor.Supervisor` yet. Callers that construct a
Supervisor without supplying a rail get the same behavior they always
have — the Supervisor builds its own rail internally.

Later decomposition steps (see issues #179 and beyond) promote the rail
from "accessor bag" to the place that actually drives startup and
shutdown.

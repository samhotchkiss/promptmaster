"""In-session ``<system-update>`` notice injection (#718).

**Default-disabled as of #755/#763.** Models treat a ``<system-update>``
tag delivered via user-turn input as a prompt-injection attack pattern
(correctly — the tag has no provenance the model can verify). So the
default ``pm upgrade`` path no longer calls into this module; post-
upgrade behavior is driven by the sentinel flag at
``~/.pollypm/post-upgrade.flag`` and the cockpit restart-nudge from #719.

The module remains available for explicit opt-in use (e.g. a future
``pm upgrade --force-notify`` flag or debug scripts). When it IS
invoked, it now resolves role-guide paths to **absolute** locations
inside the target project's ``.pollypm/`` so sessions can actually
resolve them regardless of their working directory (#762/#763), and it
rejects calls with test-fixture version pairs (#756) unless explicitly
allowed.

Resolution priority for each session's role-guide path:
1. Project-local fork at ``<project>/.pollypm/project-guides/<role>.md``
   (from #733).
2. Built-in source from ``pollypm.project_guides.built_in_guide_source_path``.

Consumed by ``pm upgrade`` (#716) only when explicit opt-in is set.

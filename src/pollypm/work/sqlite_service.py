"""SQLite-backed implementation of the WorkService protocol.

Contract:
- Inputs: typed task/workflow fields, notification metadata, dependency
  links, worker-session updates, and sync adapter names.
- Outputs: typed ``Task`` / ``WorkerSessionRecord`` models plus durable
  side effects in the work SQLite database.
- Side effects: owns schema creation, task state transitions, workflow
  execution bookkeeping, dependency mutations, notification staging, and
  sync-attempt persistence.
- Invariants: this module is the only owner of work-database connection
  lifecycle and schema writes; callers use typed methods instead of
  reaching into ``_conn`` or issuing ad-hoc SQL.
- Allowed dependencies: flow engine, gates, schema helpers, and the
  boundary-owned ``service_*.py`` submodules in this package.
- Private: SQL row shapes, sqlite connection helpers, and internal
  adapter plumbing delegated to the ``service_*.py`` modules.

        The approve dirty-tree gate (#930 + #945) lets a known set of
        scaffold files past even when untracked. Git's merge engine,
        however, refuses to overwrite untracked working-tree files —
        so when the worker's branch commits the same allowlisted file
        the merge aborts with "untracked working tree files would be
        overwritten" (#946).

        For each untracked allowlisted entry we now branch on whether
        the worker's branch tip commits that path:

        - **Worker branch has the path**: delete the working-tree copy
          so ``git merge`` can bring in the worker's authoritative
          content. This matches the allowlist's contract: every
          covered path is exclusively PollyPM-written (deployToken
          JSON, marker-bearing scaffold docs, the issues/ tree, etc.),
          so the worker's commit is the right post-merge truth.

        - **Worker branch does NOT have the path** (#947): stage and
          commit the file on the current branch *before* the merge so
          it's preserved through the merge. Without this, an untracked
          ``.itsalive`` written by a separate ``pm itsalive deploy``
          run would be silently deleted on every approve — destroying
          the deploy config the worker just produced.

        Only files matching the same allowlist as the dirty-tree gate
        are touched. Modified-but-tracked entries are skipped (they
        don't trigger the untracked-overwrite error). Anything outside
        the allowlist is left alone — we never blanket-delete user

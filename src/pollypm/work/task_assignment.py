"""Task-assignment event types, role resolution helpers, and message formatters.

When a task transitions to a state whose current flow node has
``actor_type != user`` (i.e. a machine actor — role, agent, or
project_manager), the work service emits a :class:`TaskAssignmentEvent`
into this module's dispatch bus. The ``task_assignment_notify`` built-in
plugin subscribes here and turns events into ``SessionService.send()``
pings.

No ``SessionService`` protocol changes: role → session mapping is pure
naming convention, implemented by :class:`SessionRoleIndex`.

    new current node expects a non-user actor.

    * ``actor_type`` — the node's ``ActorType`` (role / agent /
      project_manager). Never ``HUMAN`` — those transitions go to a user
      inbox, not a session ping.
    * ``actor_name`` — the concrete role or agent name
      (e.g. ``"worker"``, ``"reviewer"``, ``"critic_simplicity"``).
    * ``current_node_kind`` — ``"work"`` / ``"review"`` / ``"terminal"``.
      Used by the formatter to pick between the "new work" and "review
      needed" ping variants.
    * ``work_status`` — the task's current work status (``"queued"`` /
      ``"in_progress"`` / ``"review"`` / ...). The sweeper uses this to
      re-enqueue only tasks sitting in ``queued`` or ``review``.
    * ``execution_version`` — the ``work_node_executions.visit`` counter
      for ``(task, current_node)`` at event-build time (#279). A
      reject-bounce that reopens an earlier node bumps the visit, which
      lets the notify dedupe treat the retry ping as a meaningfully-new
      event rather than suppressing it inside the 30-min window.
      Defaults to ``0`` for environments that can't compute a visit
      (bare test doubles, pre-#279 rehydrated events) — pre-migration
      dedupe semantics survive the default because existing
      ``task_notifications`` rows back-fill to ``0`` as well.

    Project-scoped roles (``worker``, ``architect``) expand to both

    convention so drift between docs and shipping code doesn't break
    lookup. Process-wide singletons (reviewer / operator / heartbeat /
    triage) map to their fixed session names via ``_ROLE_STATIC_NAMES``,
    BUT when a non-empty ``project`` is supplied we also include the
    per-project session form (``<role>_<project>``, ``<role>-<project>``)
    *before* the singleton fallback. ``pm worker-start --role reviewer
    <project>`` (and #1005's auto-recovery dispatch that mirrors it)
    creates a per-project ``reviewer_<project>`` session; without the
    per-project candidate the resolver only sees the singleton form and
    keeps reporting ``no_session`` even after the spawn lands. The
    singleton candidates stay in the list so workspaces that still run
    a singleton ``reviewer``/``operator`` session keep resolving via
    the legacy fallback. (#1011)

    When ``task_number`` is supplied for the ``worker`` role (#921), the
    canonical per-task window name (``task-<project>-<N>``, written by
    :func:`pollypm.work.session_manager.task_window_name`) is prepended

    convention; the legacy long-lived ``worker-<project>`` /
    ``worker_<project>`` sessions remain accepted as fallbacks so a
    project that still runs a long-lived worker (e.g. booktalk's pre-
    existing setup) keeps working.

    #1057 — the per-task window also fulfills NON-worker roles for that
    specific task. When the planner spawns critic subtasks the task is
    in_progress with assignee ``critic_simplicity`` (or similar planner-
    emitted role) and a ``task-<project>-<N>`` window is doing the work.
    The role-assignment resolver must accept that window as fulfillment
    so the ``no_session_for_assignment`` alert doesn't fire spuriously.
    The shape: when ``task_number`` is supplied for *any* role, prepend
    ``task-<project>-<N>`` ahead of the role-specific candidates. The
    long-lived ``<role>-<project>`` / ``<role>_<project>`` candidates

"""Worker-session persistence for the SQLite work service.

Contract:
- Inputs: a ``SQLiteWorkService`` plus worker-session identifiers and
  counters.
- Outputs: typed ``WorkerSessionRecord`` rows.
- Side effects: creates and mutates ``work_sessions`` rows.
- Invariants: SessionManager uses this module instead of reaching into
  ``SQLiteWorkService._conn`` directly.

    been written by an earlier session's teardown / partial archival.
    The user-visible symptom on ``bikepath/8`` was ``pm task get`` showing
    ``in=0 out=0`` for a worker that had clearly burned real tokens
    across multiple build cycles.

    The next teardown's ``end_worker_session`` rescans the worktree's
    accumulated JSONL files and writes the cumulative total via SET
    semantics, so preserving the prior totals here doesn't risk
    double-counting — we just keep the running tally visible between

"""Auto-recovery for ``<role>/no_session`` alerts (#1005).

Background
----------
When a task is routed to a role (typically ``reviewer``, ``architect``, or
``worker``) and no live session matches, the task-assignment plugin
raises a ``no_session`` alert. The alert message includes a ``Try:`` hint
suggesting ``pm worker-start --role <role> <project>`` — but until #1005
this was a manual instruction. A task in ``review`` waits forever on a
reviewer that no human has remembered to spin up.

This module watches the open alert set on each heartbeat sweep and
attempts that exact ``worker-start`` automatically. The heartbeat-side
recovery_limit pattern is the model: bounded retries with backoff, then
escalate to a sibling alert that calls a human in.

Behaviour
---------
On each call:

1. Enumerate open alerts whose ``alert_type == "no_session"``.
2. For each, derive ``(role, project)`` from the alert sender + body.
3. Skip alerts younger than ``threshold_seconds`` (default 60s) — gives
   the task-claim path a moment to win the race before we step in.
4. Count prior spawn-attempt events for this ``(role, project)`` and
   honour an exponential backoff between attempts
   (``backoff_base_seconds * 2**attempt``, capped at ``backoff_cap_seconds``).
5. After ``max_attempts`` failures, raise a sibling
   ``<expected_session>/no_session_spawn_failed`` alert and stop trying.
6. Otherwise, call the same code path as ``pm worker-start`` and record a
   ``no_session_spawn_attempt`` event so future ticks see the attempt.

The successful-path teardown of the original ``no_session`` alert is
handled elsewhere — once the spawned session is live, the next sweep tick
finds the role and ``_emit_no_session_alert`` stops re-emitting (the
``upsert_alert`` row drops out of the open set when ``clear_alert`` fires
on session attach, or naturally ages out via the existing flow).

Constraints
-----------
* Does NOT touch the per-task ``no_session_for_assignment:<id>`` family —
  those clear themselves when the task transitions, and a per-task spawn
  would race with ``task claim``. The project-level ``<role>/no_session``
  alert is the canonical signal that the project's role lane is empty.
* Treats unconfigured projects as a no-op (the registry guard already
  drops ghost-project alerts elsewhere; we mirror it here so a partially-
  loaded ``services`` object can't trigger a spawn).
* Worker-role alerts are skipped: per-task workers are spawned by
  ``pm task claim``, not by ``pm worker-start --role worker`` (which is
  deprecated — see ``cli_features/workers.py``). The ``Try:`` hint
  intentionally surfaces ``pm task claim`` first for that case.

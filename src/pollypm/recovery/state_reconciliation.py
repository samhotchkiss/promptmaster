"""Flow-state reconciliation — detect observable drift between a task's
current flow node and the deliverables sitting on disk / in the ledger.

Dogfood surfaced a class of failure the heartbeat couldn't catch: an
agent writes the plan artifacts, fires a ``pm notify``, ends its turn,
but the work-service task node never advances. Everything looks done
except the one row of state the rest of the system reads from.

This module owns the ``reconcile_expected_advance`` helper — a pure
function that inspects the task's flow, the project's working tree, and
the state-store ledger for ``inbox.message.created`` events, and
returns the node the task *should* be at (if drift is detected) or
``None`` when nothing's amiss.

V1 scope — **log + alert only**. The heartbeat sweep raises a
``state_drift`` alert and records a ``state_drift`` event so the
operator sees the divergence; it does **not** auto-advance the task.
Auto-advance is explicitly a v2 concern (``[recovery].auto_reconcile``
flag) so we don't silently mutate work_tasks in response to a heuristic.

Heuristics (start narrow; this is the first pass):

* For tasks on the ``plan_project`` flow:
    - ``<project_path>/docs/plan/plan.md`` OR
      ``<project_path>/docs/project-plan.md`` exists AND is > 500
      bytes of non-whitespace content → observable deliverables say
      the ``synthesize`` stage has finished.
    - An ``inbox.message.created`` event exists in the last hour whose
      message mentions the plan being ready ("plan ready",
      "plan is ready", "plan ready for approval") → observable
      signal that the agent already announced completion, so the
      intended next stage is ``user_approval``.
    - Both → reconciliation target is ``user_approval``.
    - Plan file only, no notify → target is ``synthesize`` (the plan
      exists but the announcement hasn't landed yet; the agent is
      mid-synthesize and needs a nudge to close out the node).

* For any task:
    - If the task's current node carries an ``artifact_gate`` that
      points to a file, and that file exists with non-trivial
      content, the node is observably done. (Left as a hook — no
      flow currently uses ``artifact_gate``; the function is ready
      for when one does.)

* **Never** auto-advance past a human-review node. When the target
  node is ``user_approval`` (or any node with ``actor_type=human``
  in v2), the helper still returns the action — but the sweep
  handler raises an alert rather than mutating state.

The function is pure: take ``(task, project_path, work_service,
state_store=None)`` → return ``ReconciliationAction | None``. Easy to
unit-test without live sessions or a running work-service.

"""Worker turn-end auto-reprompt — #302.

Workers are never supposed to require a user touch: every turn must end
with a task state flip (done / bounce / notify). When #296's drift
detector catches a worker that ended its turn without advancing the
task, this module decides what to do next:

1. If the worker's recent transcript carries blocker/question language
   ("unclear", "waiting for", "need decision", etc.) OR an unfulfilled
   ``pm notify`` attempt, we treat the turn-end as an implicit
   escalation and create a ``blocking_question`` inbox item targeted
   at the project's PM. The worker stays parked — the PM is the one
   who unblocks.

2. Otherwise we assume the worker stalled without asking and send a
   standard reprompt via ``pm send --force``, reminding it that turns
   must always flip task state.

One path or the other — never both. The decision is a simple keyword
heuristic; an LLM assist is a v2 concern (Sam's call). Non-worker
sessions (PM / architect / reviewer) skip this module entirely; they
fall back to the existing log + alert behaviour from #296.

Keep this module pure-ish: the ``determine_worker_response`` function
is a pure classifier over a transcript string, and the two apply
helpers accept already-resolved services (work_service,
session_service, state_store) so tests can wire fakes without
bootstrapping a real runtime.

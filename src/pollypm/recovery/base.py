"""Recovery policy protocol and shared data types.

A ``RecoveryPolicy`` classifies session health from raw signals and
selects an intervention (or none) based on the health plus a history of
previous interventions. Policies make decisions only — the Supervisor
applies them (sending nudges, relaunching sessions, clearing alerts).

This module intentionally keeps the surface tiny:

  * :class:`SessionSignals` — the inputs a policy sees.
  * :class:`SessionHealth` — the classification output.
  * :class:`InterventionAction` — the decision output.
  * :class:`InterventionHistoryEntry` — per-session intervention history.
  * :class:`RecoveryPolicy` — the protocol plugins implement.

"""Workspace SQLite connection PRAGMAs (#1018) and open-time diagnostics (#1095).

Post-#1004 collapsed all per-project DBs into a single workspace-root
``state.db``. The default rollback-journal mode serialises every writer,
so under heartbeat + JobWorkerPool load (4 workers x ``@every 10s``
``session.health_sweep`` + token-ledger sync + alert upserts) callers
hit ``sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`` mid-transaction,
which JobWorkerPool then escalates to a ``critical_error`` alert
(#67108).

Two cheap pragmas remove the contention:

* ``PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`` lets readers run concurrently with a
  single writer instead of locking each other out. The setting is
  persistent — once a DB is in WAL mode it stays in WAL mode for every
  subsequent connection until an ``rollback`` re-issues the pragma.
  We re-issue it on every fresh connection anyway so newly-created
  DBs (tests, fresh installs) flip into WAL on first open.
* ``PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`` tells SQLite to spin-wait up to 5s for
  a transient lock before raising ``database is locked``. Combined
  with WAL this collapses the lock window to milliseconds in practice.

The helper is deliberately tolerant — read-only ``file:...?mode=ro``
URIs reject ``journal_mode=WAL`` (the DB is immutable), so we swallow
that specific failure and still apply ``busy_timeout``.

Centralising here means future tuning (e.g. raising ``synchronous`` to
``NORMAL``, or wiring in ``wal_autocheckpoint``) lands at one site
rather than the >20 ``sqlite3.connect`` call-sites currently scattered
through the tree.

#1021 follow-up
---------------
The first pass of #1018 only wrapped ``JobWorkerPool._run_one`` with
retry-on-lock. Three callers still propagated ``database is locked``
to the operator (``queue.enqueue``, ``queue.fail``, and
``HeartbeatRail.tick`` itself), which crashed the heartbeat ticker and
took every heartbeat-driven recovery surface offline. The shared
:func:`retry_on_database_locked` helper below collapses that retry
policy into one place so every write surface gets the same backoff
ladder, and :func:`is_database_locked_error` exposes the same
narrow-error predicate to non-worker callers.

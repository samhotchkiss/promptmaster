"""`pm migrate` — schema migration gate CLI (#717).

Contract:
- Inputs: ``--check`` for dry-run, ``--apply`` for real upgrades, plus
  the standard ``--config`` option so the workspace state.db resolves
  exactly like every other ``pm`` command.
- Outputs: human-readable progress lines on stdout, diagnostics on
  stderr, standard exit codes (0 on success, 2 when a pending migration
  would block, 3 on dry-run failure, 4 when ``--apply`` would race a
  live cockpit/rail_daemon — see #1006).
- Side effects (``--check``): copies the workspace state.db to
  ``~/.pollypm/migration-check.db`` and applies pending migrations
  against the clone.
- Side effects (``--apply``): opens the live state.db and runs pending
  migrations atomically per-migration. Refuses when ``rail_daemon`` is
  alive (#1006) — running migrations underneath a live JobWorkerPool
  closes per-project DB handles the pool is still using and triggers a
  ``Cannot operate on a closed database`` cascade that zombies the
  cockpit. Pass ``--force`` to override (only safe if you're certain no
  worker is mid-flight).
- Invariants: never mutates the live DB during ``--check``. Sets
  ``POLLYPM_SKIP_MIGRATION_GATE`` before opening the store so the gate
  in ``pm up`` cannot loop on itself.

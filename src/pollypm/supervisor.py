"""PollyPM Supervisor — session orchestration over tmux.

Contract:
- Inputs: ``PollyPMConfig``, tmux/session state, state-store handles,
  and collaborator boundaries such as launch planners, recovery policy,
  heartbeat backend, and session services.
- Outputs: launch/recovery/status side effects plus typed session/window
  snapshots returned through the public supervisor API.
- Side effects: boots and repairs tmux sessions, launches providers via
  delegated planners/services, writes state-store updates, and mediates
  recovery/probe/control-home workflows.
- Invariants: external callers go through ``pollypm.service_api``; the
  supervisor orchestrates boundaries rather than letting callers reach
  into provider/runtime/session internals directly.
- Allowed dependencies: public collaborators in ``core``, ``launch_planner``,
  ``recovery``, ``session_services``, ``supervision``, and state/store APIs.
- Private: remaining tmux-layout/bootstrap details and legacy helper
  methods that have not yet been extracted.

Status: **late-stage decomposition** (see issues #179, #186). The
Supervisor used to own every moving part of PollyPM's runtime; steps
0–8 of the split extracted the durable pieces into dedicated modules:

* ``pollypm.core.CoreRail`` — process-wide startup/shutdown rail.
* ``pollypm.launch_planner`` / ``default_launch_planner`` — plan_launches
  + effective_session + tmux_session_for_launch + launch_by_session.
* ``pollypm.recovery`` / ``DefaultRecoveryPolicy`` — health classification
  and intervention-ladder policy.
* ``pollypm.session_services`` — tmux mechanics, session lifecycle.
* ``pollypm.heartbeat`` / ``HeartbeatRail`` — sealed tick + job queue
  + worker pool.
* ``pollypm.core.console_window`` — cockpit console window manager (#186).

What's left on this class is what hasn't been teased apart yet:
tmux bootstrap + layout, session stabilization, recovery interventions,
and the send_input surface. Removing Supervisor outright (or renaming it
to ``LegacySupervisor``) was considered in #186 and deferred — the
remaining surface is big enough that a single rename would ripple
through every internal caller with zero architectural benefit. Instead,
Supervisor stays as the orchestrator of those remaining responsibilities
while future issues peel off one subsystem at a time.

External callers **must** route through ``pollypm.service_api`` — the
import-boundary test (``tests/test_import_boundary.py``) enforces that
Supervisor-direct imports are confined to the allow-list.

        Capturing the UUID created for this tmux window lets later restarts
        use ``claude --resume <uuid>`` instead.

        #935 — control sessions sharing one ``cwd`` (operator + heartbeat
        both default to the workspace root) write into one Claude
        transcript bucket. ``previous_ids`` alone can't disambiguate
        which fresh UUID belongs to *this* tmux window when both control
        launches race to create transcripts in the same bucket. Mis-
        attribution stuck the operator's resume marker on the
        heartbeat's transcript UUID, so every later operator launch
        ``claude --resume``'d into the heartbeat conversation and the
        ``Read .../heartbeat.md`` bootstrap replayed verbatim into the
        operator pane (issue #935 reproduction). Defense: only persist
        a UUID that is BOTH (a) freshly created by this launch — i.e.
        not in ``previous_ids`` — AND (b) whose transcript's first user
        message references this session's ``<session_name>.md`` control
        prompt — the bootstrap text PollyPM itself materialised in
        :meth:`_prepare_initial_input` for this launch and no other. If
        no candidate matches, no marker is written and the next launch
        starts cleanly via the fresh-launch path rather than poisoning
        the operator pane with a sibling role's replayed transcript.

        This method is called AFTER :meth:`_send_initial_input_if_fresh`
        so the bootstrap text has already been written into the
        transcript by Claude Code by the time the validator reads the
        first user message — earlier (pre-bootstrap) call sites would
        see only the empty pre-bootstrap transcript and either fail to
        capture (refuses to write) or — under the older permissive

        *secondary* send (after a wrong role's banner has already landed

        looks identical to a fresh pane awaiting the right role until
        the kickoff actually lands. Resolving the pane to its window
        and matching against ``launch.window_name`` catches the crossed
        primary send before the kickoff is delivered.

        ``target`` may be a pane id (``%5``), a window target
        (``session:window``), or a window-and-pane target
        (``session:window.0``); ``list_panes`` accepts all three. We

        tmux returns just that pane, and when ``target`` is a window

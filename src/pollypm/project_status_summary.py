    """Walk a project's work service and produce a complete summary (#782).

    Fills every field on :class:`ProjectMonitorSummary` so durable
    monitor records carry the full picture the issue asks for:

    * ``completed_since_last`` — task IDs that hit ``done`` since the
      lookback window opened. Drives the cockpit's "what got done
      while you were away" copy and the activity feed.
    * ``stalled_tasks`` — IDs that are ``in_progress`` but haven't
      moved within the window. Distinct from ``human_blockers`` (no
      user action required) and ``completed_since_last`` (active but
      not done).
    * ``human_blockers`` — IDs in ``waiting_on_user`` / ``on_hold`` /
      ``blocked`` states. The dashboard / monitor renderer flags
      these as needing user action so they're separable from work
      Polly can advance automatically.
    * ``automatic_next_actions`` — plain-language descriptions of
      what Polly will try next without user input (claim a queued
      task, retry a stalled worker). Mostly seeded by callers; the
      helper just leaves the slot open.
    * ``zero_completion_window`` — explicit flag for the "no tasks
      completed in the window" case. The issue calls out this signal
      specifically because monitor output frequently buries it.
    * ``window_started_at`` — the lookback boundary so renderers can
      say "no completions in the last 2h" without re-deriving the
      window.

    The walk is best-effort: if a ``work_service`` query raises (DB
    closed, malformed task), that task is dropped from the summary
    rather than blowing up the whole record.

"""Centralized error log — one file, all processes, all tracebacks.

Every long-running PollyPM process (rail daemon, cockpit TUI,
``pm``-entry-point CLI calls, future workers) attaches this handler
via :func:`install` during its boot path. WARNING-and-above records
from every logger in the process land in
``~/.pollypm/errors.log`` with a header that pins process name +
pid + timestamp + logger + level + message + traceback. Single
file, line-buffered, rotated by the existing ``log.rotate``
roster handler once it crosses the configurable size cap.

Design goals:

- **One place to grep.** Plugin crashes, SQLite lock failures,
  transcript-ingest FD exhaustion, provider CLI errors — all end
  up here. Sam's question "are we logging errors?" answered in a
  single path.
- **Tracebacks included.** ``logger.exception(...)`` lands with
  the full traceback; plain ``logger.error("msg")`` lands with
  just the message. Both are useful; both are captured.
- **No dependency on the scheduler/rail.** The handler is a plain
  stdlib ``logging.FileHandler`` — safe to install before the
  plugin host / rail / event bus exist. A boot-time crash still
  gets logged.
- **Idempotent.** Calling ``install`` twice (e.g. the cockpit
  initializing after ``pm up``) doesn't duplicate lines.

``pm errors`` (see ``cli_features/maintenance.py``) tails the file
for the user. Operators who prefer their own tooling can point
any log aggregator at ``~/.pollypm/errors.log``.

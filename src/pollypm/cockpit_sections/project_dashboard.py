"""Per-project dashboard orchestrator (#403).

``_render_project_dashboard`` threads a single hydrated task list through
the section helpers so a render performs one SQLite open per project.
``_dashboard_project_tasks`` exposes the same gather to the global
dashboard with an mtime-keyed cache so unchanged projects skip re-reads
on every cockpit tick.

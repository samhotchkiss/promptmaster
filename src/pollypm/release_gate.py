"""Release verification gate for issue closure and regressions (#889).

A composable set of gates that the launch-hardening release
process consults before tagging v1. Each gate is a pure function
that returns a :class:`GateResult`; the gate run aggregates them
into a single :class:`ReleaseReport` with a ``blocked`` flag.

The pre-launch audit (``docs/launch-issue-audit-2026-04-27.md``
§8) cites the recurring shape of process failures:

* `#395` / `#501` / `#505` / `#511` / `#513` / `#515` — issues
  closed as fixed against local branch state, then reopened
  after checking ``origin/main``.
* `#840` / `#831` / `#829` / `#826` / `#820` — fixes that
  passed narrow unit tests but reproduced after a cockpit
  restart or in the rendered UI.
* `#821` regressed `#514`, `#820` regressed `#799`, `#819`
  regressed `#792` — one-day cockpit regressions in launch-
  critical surfaces.
* `#709` — main red with 12 failures and 10 errors blocking
  the desired CI gate.

The gate is the structural fix. Each gate is a small, named
predicate so the user-visible report explains exactly why the
release is blocked. Gates are not opinionated about *fixing*
problems — they only report.

Usage::

    from pollypm.release_gate import run_release_gate

    report = run_release_gate()
    if report.blocked:
        print(report.render())
        sys.exit(1)

The gate is invoked by ``scripts/release_burnin.py`` and (when
wired) by the GitHub release workflow.

# Prompt Master Architecture

## Goal

Prompt Master orchestrates multiple interactive CLI agent sessions from one control plane without replacing the native tools. Every worker remains a real `claude`, `codex`, or future CLI session inside tmux. Prompt Master supervises those sessions, logs them, and assists the operator.

## Non-goals for MVP

- exact hidden-context restoration after crashes
- full autonomous project-management judgment
- provider-specific deep integrations beyond launch and monitoring
- perfect quota accounting for subscription plans

## Core principles

1. Tmux is the shared cockpit.
2. Prompt Master is the supervisor and state authority.
3. Providers are adapters, not the center of the design.
4. Runtime isolation is a separate concern from provider behavior.
5. Human takeover must always be possible.

## Roles

### Session 0: Heartbeat supervisor

- checks all known worker sessions on a timer
- records a heartbeat snapshot
- detects likely stuck, exited, or looping sessions
- keeps launch and recovery metadata current
- runs as a true interactive provider session in tmux

### Session 1: Operator interface

- surfaces alerts and recommended actions
- lets the user inspect or control sessions
- acts as the project-manager role when enabled
- runs as a true interactive provider session in tmux

### Sessions 2+

- actual worker sessions
- each session runs one provider in one tmux window
- each session belongs to an account profile and runtime profile

## System components

### 1. Prompt Master core

Responsibilities:

- load config
- resolve accounts, runtimes, and sessions
- bootstrap tmux windows
- register sessions in the state store
- provide control and status commands

### 2. Provider adapters

Each provider adapter implements:

- binary name and availability check
- command construction for an interactive launch
- provider-specific default flags
- basic health pattern hooks

Initial adapters:

- `claude`
- `codex`

Future adapters:

- `aider`
- `gemini-cli`
- `opencode`
- any terminal-native agent CLI

### 3. Runtime adapters

Runtime adapters isolate session execution from the provider.

Initial runtime:

- `local`: launches the provider in the host environment with isolated per-account homes and provider-native profile variables such as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME`

Planned runtime:

- `docker`: one container or long-lived runtime per account profile, with isolated auth, cache, and config state

### 4. Tmux layer

Tmux is the operator-facing execution surface.

Prompt Master uses tmux for:

- window creation
- pane output logging
- session listing
- capture snapshots
- human handoff and direct interaction

Operational rule:

- Prompt Master operational commands should run only from inside the `promptmaster` tmux session
- startup is the exception: `pm up` may be run outside tmux to create or attach to the session

Important rule:

- only one active writer should control a worker pane at a time

The lease model is implemented for manual control and input arbitration. Prompt Master records lease ownership and blocks conflicting input, stop, and recovery actions unless explicitly bypassed.

### 5. State store

SQLite tracks:

- known session definitions
- launch records
- operational events
- future heartbeat snapshots and alerts

This gives Prompt Master a durable source of truth separate from the terminal UI.

## Logging model

Prompt Master should log three streams per worker:

1. pane output stream via `tmux pipe-pane`
2. supervisor-issued actions and injected prompts
3. periodic pane snapshots via `tmux capture-pane`

This scaffold implements the first and the persistent event log foundation.

## Recovery model

Prompt Master does not assume it can resume exact internal provider state. Recovery is defined as rebuilding a session from:

- git/worktree state
- session definition
- persistent transcript logs
- checkpoint summaries
- recent operational events

## Configuration model

Prompt Master config separates:

- `accounts`: credentials and isolation boundaries
- `promptmaster`: control-plane account selection and failover policy
- `sessions`: role and provider declarations

Worker sessions should be modeled per project, and Prompt Master should enforce one active worker session per project at a time.
- `project`: shared tmux and storage settings

This lets Prompt Master roles run on any provider:

- session `heartbeat` can use `claude` today and `codex` tomorrow
- session `operator` can switch independently

## MVP build order

### Phase 1

- config file and example project layout
- provider-neutral launch model
- local runtime adapter with per-account home isolation
- tmux bootstrap
- persistent launch/event storage

### Phase 2

- structured heartbeat loop
- pane snapshots
- alert rules for stuck, exited, and repeated-error sessions
- manual control commands

### Phase 3

- Docker runtime adapter
- worktree management
- pane lease ownership
- operator UI

### Phase 4

- project-manager reasoning loop
- scheduling and account balancing
- richer provider telemetry

## Biggest risks

- upstream CLI changes break terminal heuristics
- multiple subscription-account isolation is brittle without containers
- terminal output alone is ambiguous
- over-aggressive intervention reduces trust

## Practical MVP boundary

The first version should answer one question well:

Can Prompt Master reliably launch, log, inspect, and restart multiple native CLI agent sessions in tmux while preserving direct human control?

If the answer is yes, the higher-order project-management features are worth adding.

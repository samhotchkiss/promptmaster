# Cockpit Interaction Contract

Source: implements GitHub issue #881.

This document defines the runtime contract every cockpit surface
(Home, Rail, Inbox, Activity, Settings, Tasks, Project Dashboard,
PM Chat, Help) must follow. The contract has a code home at
`src/pollypm/cockpit_interaction.py` and a test home at
`tests/test_cockpit_interaction_contract.py`.

The pre-#881 audit (`docs/launch-issue-audit-2026-04-27.md` §1)
identified 26 cockpit-input/focus issues in the last 500 GitHub
issues. The deepest example was #840: a fix protected approve/reject
shortcuts only while an `Input` had focus, but a smoke test still
approved a real task because the Tasks view opened with table focus.
That class of bug is structural — it cannot be solved by another
per-screen patch. The contract below is the structural fix.

## Vocabulary

* **Surface** — a top-level cockpit App or route the user can land
  on directly (Home, Rail, Inbox, Activity, Settings, Tasks,
  Project Dashboard, PM Chat, Help). Modals are not surfaces.
* **Binding** — a key-to-action declaration. The Textual `Binding`
  class is wrapped by `CockpitBinding`, which adds two fields the
  contract needs: `scope` and `kind`.
* **Scope** — where a binding is allowed to fire.
  `GLOBAL`/`APP`/`SEARCH`/`MODAL`. See `BindingScope`.
* **Kind** — the risk class of an action.
  `NAVIGATION`/`READ`/`WRITE`/`DESTRUCTIVE`. See `ActionKind`.
* **Arming** — the two-press confirmation pattern for destructive
  single-key actions. First press arms; a second press of the same
  key on the same target within `ARM_WINDOW_SECONDS` confirms.

## Rules

### 1. Initial focus is declared, not implicit

Every surface declares its `initial_focus` (`FocusKind.TABLE`,
`LIST`, `INPUT`, `CUSTOM`, `NONE`) in its `ScreenContract`. A
surface that has a visible text input *and* destructive single-key
bindings must set `arming_required_for_destructive=True`. The audit
in `InteractionRegistry.audit()` rejects any other combination.

The Tasks surface opens with `DataTable` focus. Single-letter
`a`/`x` (approve/reject) are destructive. The screen has a visible
search `Input`. Therefore: arming is required.

### 2. Destructive actions in input-bearing surfaces require arming

Any single-key destructive action declared on a surface with
`has_visible_input=True` must run through
`destructive_action_safe(app, action, target_id=…, selection=…)`.
The helper returns `True` only when:

1. **Explicit selection** — the target id is in the screen's
   selection set (e.g., `_selected_task_ids`). The user opted in by
   pressing `space` to toggle.
2. **Confirmation press** — the same key was pressed on the same
   target within `ARM_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 3s). The first press
   arms and surfaces a hint; the second press fires.

It returns `False` (and arms, if rule 2 is the path) when:

* a text `Input` currently has focus — the keystroke belongs to
  the input, not to the destructive handler;
* this is the first press without an explicit selection.

The legacy guard `if isinstance(self.focused, Input): return` is
still acceptable on surfaces that have *no* visible text input
(e.g., the cockpit rail, the metrics drill-down modal). Surfaces
with a visible input must use `destructive_action_safe` instead.

### 3. Modal trapping suspends APP-scope bindings

When a `ModalScreen` is on top, the cockpit suspends every
`BindingScope.APP` binding for the duration of the modal. Only
`BindingScope.GLOBAL` bindings (`Ctrl+Q`, `Ctrl+W`, `?`,
`Ctrl+K`/`:`) and the modal's own `BindingScope.MODAL` bindings
fire. The audit rejects any modal that declares `BindingScope.APP`
bindings.

### 4. Search mode is exclusive

When a search `Input` has focus, single-letter `BindingScope.APP`
keys route to the input. `Escape` exits search and yields focus
back to the table. `Enter` submits and yields focus back. Global
bindings still fire.

This is enforced two ways:

* **At the binding layer**: surfaces with a search input mark
  destructive APP bindings as requiring arming (rule 2). If the
  user is typing, no Input-focus check is needed because the input
  consumes the key.
* **At the action layer**: action handlers call
  `destructive_action_safe` first thing. If `Input` has focus, the
  helper returns `False` and the action returns immediately.

### 5. Escape never silently consumes

`Escape` follows a deterministic priority:

1. If a modal is on top → close the modal.
2. If search has focus → exit search.
3. If the surface is a detail App → return to home.
4. If the surface is the home/rail App → no-op (do *not* quit).

Surfaces are forbidden from binding `Escape` to a custom action
that violates this priority order.

### 6. Quit policy

* `Ctrl+Q` is the only universal quit. It is the only
  `BindingScope.GLOBAL`-scoped binding that mutates app state.
* `q`/`Q` on the rail is also quit (the rail is the top-level
  view, so local-back and quit are the same action).
* `q`/`Q` on every other surface is local-back: pop to home.
* `Ctrl+W` detaches the tmux client without killing the cockpit.

### 7. Help text source-of-truth

The keyboard-help modal renders the bindings returned by
`help_text_for_app(app)`. That function walks the active App's
runtime `BINDINGS` plus `GLOBAL_REFERENCE_BINDINGS`. The modal is
forbidden from maintaining its own copy of binding labels.

`docs/launch-issue-audit-2026-04-27.md` cites two recurring help
bugs (#831, #826) where data was correct but the rendered help
diverged from runtime behavior. Sourcing help from runtime
`BINDINGS` makes that class of drift impossible.

## Migration

The contract is enforced for surfaces that register a
`ScreenContract` with `REGISTRY`. The cockpit surfaces register
their contracts at the bottom of their app-class module so the
audit fires on import. Surfaces that have not yet registered are
not required to comply, but the launch-hardening release gate
(#889) blocks v1 if the registered surface set does not at least
include Tasks (the #840 origin) and any other surface with a
visible text input.

When a new surface is added, its contract registration is part of
the same PR. The CI smoke test
(`tests/test_cockpit_interaction_contract.py::test_audit_clean`)
asserts `REGISTRY.audit() == []` for all registered contracts.

## Appendix: full keymap reference

The canonical list of `BindingScope.GLOBAL` keys lives in
`GLOBAL_REFERENCE_BINDINGS`. As of 2026-04-27 it is:

| Key       | Action                  | Kind       |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| `Ctrl+K`  | open_command_palette    | READ       |
| `:`       | open_command_palette    | READ       |
| `?`       | show_keyboard_help      | READ       |
| `Ctrl+Q`  | request_quit            | WRITE      |
| `Ctrl+W`  | detach                  | WRITE      |

Per-surface bindings are declared in each App's `BINDINGS` list and
mirrored into the registered `ScreenContract`. Use
`help_text_for_app(app)` at runtime; do not duplicate the list.

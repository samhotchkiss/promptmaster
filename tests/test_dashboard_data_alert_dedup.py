"""Polly-dashboard ``alert_count`` mirrors the cycle 45/53/55 dedup.

When ``stuck_on_task:<id>`` fires because the architect session sat
idle waiting for the user to respond and the task is already in a
user-waiting status, the alert is the same fact in different words.
The polly dashboard's ``alert_count`` is what drives "1 alerts" in
the top stats line; counting redundant stuck alerts there inflates
the badge for non-faults the user already sees as yellow.

"""Regression tests for issue #927 — cancelled tasks keep raising alerts.

Background:
- ``pm task cancel <project>/<n> --reason "..."`` flips the task status
  to ``cancelled`` but did NOT clear the
  ``task_assignment/no_session_for_assignment:<project>/<n>`` and
  ``worker-<project>/no_session`` alerts that the heartbeat sweep raised
  while the task was active.
- The supervisor's ``_sweep_stale_alerts`` was tightened in #919 to NOT
  clear ``no_session`` types prematurely (the alert clearer was masking
  #919's real bug). The other side of that coin is that cancelled-task
  alerts now stick around because no-one prunes them on cancel.

Two-part fix exercised here:
  Part A — cancel clears its own alerts (per-task always; project-level
  only when no other active task on the project still routes to that
  role).
  Part B — heartbeat sweep refuses to emit ``no_session_for_assignment``
  for terminal / parked status tasks (cancelled / done / on_hold /
  blocked / draft). Active-status tasks still ping normally.

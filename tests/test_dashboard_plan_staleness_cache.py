"""Cycle 133 — perf review: cache _dashboard_plan_staleness.

The per-project dashboard refresh tick (every 10s) used to call
``_dashboard_plan_staleness`` which opens SQLiteWorkService and
walks the entire task list to find the most recent backlog task.
On 9 projects that's 9 DB opens + 9 list_tasks() per tick.

The fix caches by ``(project_key, plan_mtime, db_mtime)`` —
content-addressed, no TTL needed since a new task or a plan edit
both bump one of the two mtimes. A project with no plan or task
changes pays zero work past the first refresh.

"""Cycle 139 — perf: cache _dashboard_activity by (project, db_mtime, limit).

The per-project dashboard refresh tick used to rebuild the activity-
feed projector and walk the messages table on every call — pure
repeated work when no event had landed since the last call. Cache
by db_mtime so an idle project pays one stat() per tick instead.

Sister to ``_DASHBOARD_INBOX_CACHE`` (cycle 138) and
``_PLAN_STALENESS_CACHE`` (cycle 133).

"""Regression for #1069 — task_assignment.{sweep,notify} fd leak.

#1067 fixed two leak paths in ``core_recurring`` (session.health_sweep
and alerts.gc) that each constructed a fresh ``Supervisor(config)``
without releasing it. Verifying that fix on an idle daemon showed
0 fd/min growth, but on a busy daemon (live task work, rework state
transitions) the post-#1067 daemon still grew the user-scope
``state.db`` fd count at ~9.5/min.

Root cause: ``task_assignment_notify.resolver.load_runtime_services``
opens a fresh ``StateStore`` on every call and a fresh
``SQLiteWorkService``. The cadence handlers
(``task_assignment.sweep`` @every 30s, ``task_assignment.notify``
on every state transition incl. rework/notify_rejection,
``pane.classify`` @every 30s) used to close only the work service
and leaked the state-store sqlite fd + WAL handles per tick.

This test runs each of the three handlers ~50 times against a
config-backed tmpdir and asserts the parent process's fd count
stays flat. A leak of one connection per call would surface as
~50 extra fds and fail the assertion.

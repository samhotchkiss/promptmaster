"""Regression coverage for issue #1039.

The heartbeat ``_classify`` snippet rendering used to leak ANSI control
fragments, transcript dividers, and bare bullet leaders into the
user-facing ``pm alerts`` reason text. ``_select_snippet`` is the
extracted helper that walks the transcript tail and skips uninformative
lines. This test fixture pins each of the 8 live alert samples I
collected over an overnight loop so the regression cannot slip back in.

# T055: Thread State Transitions Recorded with Timestamps

**Spec:** v1/09-inbox-and-threads
**Area:** Thread Management
**Priority:** P1
**Duration:** 10 minutes

## Objective
Verify that all thread state transitions are recorded with timestamps, providing a complete audit trail of thread lifecycle events.

## Prerequisites
- At least one thread exists (created from T054 or manually)
- `pm up` has been run

## Steps
1. Run `pm thread list` and identify a thread in "open" state. Note its ID.
2. View the thread details: `pm thread info <thread-id>`. Note the creation timestamp.
3. Transition the thread to "in_progress" (if the PM routes it to a PA for action): `pm thread transition <thread-id> in_progress` or observe the PM doing it automatically.
4. Run `pm thread info <thread-id>` again. Verify:
   - Status is now "in_progress"
   - A transition record exists with the timestamp of the change
5. Transition to "waiting" (e.g., waiting for external input): `pm thread transition <thread-id> waiting`.
6. Verify the transition is recorded with a new timestamp.
7. Transition to "resolved": `pm thread transition <thread-id> resolved`.
8. Verify the resolved transition is recorded.
9. Transition to "closed": `pm thread transition <thread-id> closed`.
10. View the complete transition history: `pm thread history <thread-id>` or inspect the thread file. Verify all transitions are present with timestamps in chronological order: open -> in_progress -> waiting -> resolved -> closed.

## Expected Results
- Each state transition is recorded with an accurate timestamp
- Transition history shows all states the thread passed through
- Timestamps are in chronological order
- Thread info command shows current state and last transition time
- Complete audit trail is available via thread history

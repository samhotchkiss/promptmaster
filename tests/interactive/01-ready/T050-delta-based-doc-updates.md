# T050: Delta-Based Doc Updates Preserve Unchanged Sections

**Spec:** v1/08-project-state-and-memory
**Area:** Documentation
**Priority:** P1
**Duration:** 10 minutes

## Objective
Verify that when documentation is updated, only the changed sections are modified and unchanged sections are preserved exactly as-is (delta-based updates, not full rewrites).

## Prerequisites
- A project exists with generated documentation
- At least one document has been generated and is stable

## Steps
1. Pick a documentation file to test (e.g., `.pollypm/docs/architecture.md`).
2. Read the current content and note its structure (section headings, content in each section).
3. Calculate a checksum for the file: `md5 .pollypm/docs/architecture.md` (or `md5sum`). Record it.
4. Make a change that should trigger a documentation update to one section only. For example, add a new component to the project or modify an architectural decision.
5. Trigger a documentation update: `pm docs update` or wait for the scheduled extraction cycle.
6. Read the updated file and compare with the previous version.
7. Verify that the section affected by the change has been updated with new content.
8. Verify that sections NOT affected by the change are IDENTICAL to the previous version (same wording, same formatting, same line breaks).
9. Use `diff` to compare: save the old version beforehand and run `diff old-version.md .pollypm/docs/architecture.md`. Only the relevant section should show changes.
10. Repeat with a different change and verify the delta behavior holds.

## Expected Results
- Only the changed section is modified in the document
- Unchanged sections are byte-for-byte identical to the previous version
- `diff` shows minimal, targeted changes
- No full rewrites of documents for partial updates
- Document structure and formatting are preserved

# T049: Memory Scopes (Global, Project, Issue, Session, Thread)

**Spec:** v1/08-project-state-and-memory
**Area:** Memory and Context
**Priority:** P0
**Duration:** 15 minutes

## Objective
Verify that the memory system supports all five scopes (global, project, issue, session, thread) and that each scope is isolated and accessible from the correct context.

## Prerequisites
- `pm up` has been run with a project active
- At least one issue exists and is being worked on

## Steps
1. Check for global memory: look for a global memory file (e.g., `~/.config/pollypm/memory.md` or equivalent). If it exists, note its contents. If not, create an entry via `pm memory set --scope global --key "test_key" --value "global_value"` or equivalent.
2. Check for project memory: look in `.pollypm/memory/` or equivalent. Verify project-level memory entries exist (e.g., project overview, project decisions).
3. Check for issue memory: find an active issue and look for issue-scoped memory (e.g., within the issue file or `.pollypm/issues/<id>/memory/`).
4. Check for session memory: look for session-scoped data (e.g., `.pollypm/sessions/<session-id>/memory/`). This should contain session-specific context like checkpoints.
5. Check for thread memory: if threads/inbox items exist, look for thread-scoped memory.
6. Verify scope isolation: data in project memory should NOT appear in global memory. Data in issue memory should NOT appear in other issues.
7. Start a worker session and verify it has access to the correct scopes:
   - Global memory: yes
   - Project memory: yes (for its assigned project)
   - Issue memory: yes (for its assigned issue)
   - Session memory: yes (for its own session)
   - Other project's memory: no
8. Modify a project memory entry and verify it does not affect global or issue memory.
9. Verify memory persistence: restart the system and check that all memory scopes retain their data.
10. List all memory entries per scope: `pm memory list --scope <scope>` for each scope.

## Expected Results
- All five memory scopes exist and are functional
- Scopes are properly isolated (no data leakage between scopes)
- Workers have access to the correct combination of scopes
- Memory persists across restarts
- Memory entries can be listed, read, and modified per scope

"""Tests for `pm upgrade` (#716).

Exercises the installer-detection priority, per-installer plan shape,
channel routing, migration-check gating, and the CLI wiring.

Every test that would otherwise touch the real system uses the
``installer_overrides`` / ``emit`` / ``plan_only`` seams on
``upgrade()`` — no real ``uv``/``pip``/``brew``/``npm`` shells fire.
